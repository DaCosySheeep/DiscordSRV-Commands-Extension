This is a plugin that adds some useful slash commands to the DiscordSRV discord bot.
Commands include whitelist management, server power management and a player list command.

Full list of current commands:
- /whitelist add | username | discord-user(optional) - add a user to the whitelist and optionally link their discord account
- /whitelist list - list players on the whitelist
- /whitelist remove | username - remove a player from the whitelist

- /restart - restart the server
- /stop - stop the server

- /list - list online players (returns an ephemeral message)

A discord support server will be coming soon.
